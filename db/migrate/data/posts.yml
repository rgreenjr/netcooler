  title:        Yahoo + Yang = Google + (Page + Brin)?
  url:          http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&art_aid=62725
  body:         So JERRY YANG is no longer just the chief Yahoo, whatever that means. Terry Semel has vacated Yahoo's CEO office and Jerry Yang has set up shop there. At the same time, Sue Decker has stepped into the president's role. While Terry Semel's departure didn't come as a great surprise to anyone in the search space, Jerry Yang's appointment as CEO did raise a few eyebrows. In retrospect, the move seems to make a lot of sense but in the numerous conversations I've had on this topic in the last few weeks, no one mentioned Yang's name as Yahoo's possible savior. With this move will come the inevitable speculation about how this will bolster Yahoo's chances of competing against Google. Just last week I was interviewed by Bloomberg TV and was asked about that very topic. At that time I mentioned that the biggest difference between the two was the lack of corporate focus at Yahoo and the fact that focus, at least on the search side, has never been an issue for Google.

  url:          http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-GE-Pearson-Dow-Jones.html
  body:         NEW YORK (AP) -- General Electric Co. said Thursday it has abandoned talks with Financial Times publisher Pearson PLC about a possible bid for Dow Jones & Co., removing a potential rival to a $5 billion offer from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. GE said it held ''exploratory discussions'' with London-based Pearson about combining GE's CNBC business news cable channel, Pearson's Financial Times newspaper and Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and Dow Jones Newswires, but decided not to proceed. Pearson's CEO Marjorie Scardino told FT staff in a note that given News Corp.'s interest in Dow Jones and Thomson Corp.'s pending deal to acquire Reuters Group PLC, Pearson had ''kicked around some ideas'' about combining CNBC, the FT and Dow Jones, but ''didn't see that combination stacking up for our shareholders.''

  title:        Google joins carbon-neutral party
  url:          http://www.pcw.co.uk/vnunet/news/2192548/google-joins-carbon-neutral
  body:         Google has become the latest company to adopt a carbon-neutral initiative, promising to offset 100 per cent of its emissions by the end of 2007. The search giant will also look at ways to cut its energy consumption and make more use of renewable energy sources. The offsets will be purchased to negate the carbon emitted by Google's data centre energy consumption, employee vehicle emissions and hardware manufacturing. Carbon offsets are credits purchased by companies which represent a section of reforestation. The theory is that newly planted trees process the same amount of emitted carbon as represented in the offset, resulting in a 'neutral' level of carbon emissions.

  body:         Blackstone Group LP, undeterred by congressional attempts to raise taxes on private-equity firms, raised $4.13 billion in the largest U.S. initial public offering in five years. Blackstone, founded by former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. executives Stephen Schwarzman and Peter G. Peterson in 1985 with $400,000, said today in a statement it sold 133.3 million shares for $31 each, the top of its expected range. Sale of the 12.3 percent stake values the New York-based firm at $33.5 billion.

  body:         Brad Greenspan, the 34-year-old former chief executive of the MySpace social networking site, has emerged with a rival proposal for the future of The Wall Street Journal - pitching him into a second bitter conflict with the septuagenarian media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Mr Murdoch's proposed $5bn (£2.5bn) takeover of the Journal's parent company, Dow Jones, appeared to move a step closer yesterday after the collapse of talks between Pearson, owner of The Financial Times, and General Electric, which owns the financial news channel CNBC, which had been aimed at making a joint bid to rival that from Mr Murdoch's News Corp. But Mr Greenspan has emerged with an alternative plan to invest $1.5bn (£750m) for a 25 per cent stake in Dow Jones and to offer advice aimed at improving the profitability of its internet properties, including WSJ.com and the financial news site MarketWatch.

They've built it into a Wall Street powerhouse that has positioned Schwarzman, especially, as a new century answer to the 1980s "Masters of the Universe."

Steve Wozniak arrived at the Apple store at Valley Fair Mall in San Jose at 4 a.m. to begin the wait wearing a button that read, "The line starts here. Woz #1." In fact, he hadn't been the first to show up but in deference, Apple fans stepped aside to give him the first space.

The News Corporation-owned social networking site is set to lock horn's with one of the prized jewels in Google's crown by opening up access to videos of classic television shows along with user-generated content.

They were motivated, they said, by the increasing number of Americans going without health insurance, a concern presumably unrelated to SiCKO, Michael Moore’s new and very popular film on the failings of the U.S. health care system, and by a mystifying public perception that “that our industry might be opposed to reform.”

  body:         There are rumors and then there are RUMORS. This one fits in the latter category, with a bullet. The rumor apparently started with a New York magazine biography of Steve Jobs, penned by John Heilemann, in which he quotes an anonymous friend of Jobs as saying "I think that Google is going to buy Apple. It would be a victory for Apple; they'd get major-league partners, money, and engineers. And it would be a victory for Steve -- a huge win that lets him leave the stage."

  body:         Check this out from ValleyWag - Here's another indication that Meg Whitman's online auction monopoly, which threw two people out of a party just because they were wearing Google teeshirts, is rattled. We're hearing that Bill Cobb, head of Ebay's business in its home market, is out. Officially, the line is that Cobb, president of Ebay North America, is taking a sabbatical, but he's not expected to return. Ebay's domestic auction business is stagnating, and under threat from Google, which is wooing stores with text ads and cut-rate credit-card processing. Anyone have the back story on this?
