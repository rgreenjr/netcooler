  body:             So we should expect some more leather sleeves and perhaps a new boombox? Oh, and maybe a new computer. I remember what happened last time we all got excited about an Apple event.

  body:             Maybe the Apple stores in California update immediately, but the one near where I work in Texas takes a few days to get the new stuff. We've gone a few times during lunch on the day of, and the day after big announcements and haven't seen whatever it was they announced (nano, macbook, etc). They had a launch party for OS X, but anything being announced by "suprise" won't be available right away.

  body:             An Apple special event where the aforementioned items were released is considerably different than WWDC.
