# great way to DRY up your controllers if you use save! and create! in your RESTful application.
rescue_from  ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid do |exception|
  render :action => (exception.record.new_record? ? 'new' : 'edit')

Action Pack: Exception handling

Lots of common exceptions would do better to be rescued at a shared level rather than per action. This has always been possible by overwriting rescue_action_in_public, but then you had to roll out your own case statement and call super. Bah. So now we have a class level macro called rescue_from, which you can use to declaratively point certain exceptions to a given action. Example:

  class PostsController < ApplicationController
    rescue_from User::NotAuthorized, :with => :deny_access

    protected
      def deny_access
        ...
      end
  end
